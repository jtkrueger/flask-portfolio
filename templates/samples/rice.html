			<h1>Rice University Giving Redesign</h1>
			<h3><strong>Role:</strong> Interaction Design, UI/UX Design, Web Design, Frontend, jQuery</h3>
			<h3><strong>Date:</strong> October 2014</h3>

			<p>Rice University is one of the most reputable private universities in Texas, and it was quite a treat working with their <a href="http://giving.rice.edu/">Development and Alumni Relations</a> department on this project. We kept close to the Universityâ€™s branding and colors although we did decide to reinvigorate the typography with typeface heavyweights Gotham and Sentinel from the Hoefler &amp; Co. foundry. The website itself consisted of quite a variety of page elements and UI blocks including donation campaign countdowns, progress meters and bars, FAQ fields, slideshows, blogs, and calendars.</p>

			<p>I was primarily in charge of the look and feel of the site, while also modeling the data and structure of the site for the backend developer, and making tweaks to the frontend behind our lead frontend developer. I also met with the clients to assess needs and new features, and also performed quality assurance for the site to help the launch go smoothly.</p>
